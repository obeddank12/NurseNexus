# NurseNexus
NurseNexus is a student-led hub that translates dense medical theory into simplified clinical support. We bridge the gap between textbooks and the bedside by breaking down complex conditions into high-yield, actionable guides. Built for student nurses to master pathophysiology and prioritize patient care during fast-paced rotations.

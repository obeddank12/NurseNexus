# 🩺 NurseHub | Clinical Excellence Portal

Welcome to **NurseHub**, a professional digital companion for nursing students and healthcare professionals. This platform was designed to bridge the gap between complex medical theory and real-world nursing practice.

## 👨‍⚕️ About the Creator
Developed by **Dankwah Obed Asante**, a Level 300 Student Nurse at the **College of Nursing and Midwifery - Mampong, Ashanti**. 

In the clinical wards of Ghana, knowledge is the most powerful tool we carry. This project was built to transform complex pathophysiology into clear, actionable nursing care plans to improve patient outcomes and student clinical success.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Systems-Based Dashboard:** Navigate clinical conditions by body system (Cardiovascular, Respiratory, etc.).
- **Level 300 Clinical Guides:** In-depth pathophysiology (The "Triple Threat" of Asthma), pharmacology, and nursing priorities.
- **Interactive Tools:** Dynamic Vital Signs reference (Fetal to Adult) and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) calculators.
- **Clinical Mnemonics:** Memory aids like "UNLOAD FAST" for Heart Failure and "BE-FAST" for Stroke.
- **DASH Diet & Medication Safety:** Integrated patient education and safety protocols.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- **HTML5:** Semantic structure for medical documentation.
- **CSS3:** Professional clinical theme with a responsive grid layout.
- **JavaScript:** Dynamic vital signs switching and alphabetical clinical indexing.

## 📖 How to Use
1. **Browse Diseases:** Use the A-Z Index to find specific conditions.
